## Project

A Docker container GitHub Action. It wraps
`synapseclient.extensions.curator.register_jsonschema` to register each `*.json`
file in a directory as a JSON Schema in a Synapse organization. It is part of
DPE-1554 (automated JSON Schema management). It runs after the sibling action
`generate-jsonschema`, which makes the schema files. ELITE and ADKP data-model
repos use the two actions together.

## Stack

- Python and synapseclient (with curator extras), both from the base image
  `ghcr.io/sage-bionetworks/synapsepythonclient:vX.Y.Z`. The `Dockerfile` `FROM`
  tag sets the version.
- pytest (tests only, from `requirements.txt`).
- Linter configs exist at the root (markdownlint, yamllint, prettier, checkov,
  trivy), but CI does not run a linter.

## Commands

```bash
SYN_VERSION=$(sed -n 's/^FROM .*synapsepythonclient:v\([0-9.]*\).*/\1/p' Dockerfile | head -n1)  # inferred
pip install "synapseclient[curator]==${SYN_VERSION}"   # same as CI
pip install -r requirements.txt
SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN=... python -m pytest tests -v       # run from the repo root
docker build -t register-jsonschema-action .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/tests/schema_dir:/schema_dir -e ORG_NAME=dpetest \
  -e SCHEMA_DIR=/schema_dir -e FIX_SCHEMA_NAME=true \
  -e SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN="$SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN" register-jsonschema-action
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) has 4 jobs: pytest, a Docker run, a run of the
local action (`uses: ./`), and a full workflow with `generate-jsonschema@main`
followed by `uses: ./`. All 4 jobs call the real Synapse with the
`SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN` secret.

## Data Models

- **Inputs:** `action.yml` `inputs` → `runs.env` (`ORG_NAME`, `SCHEMA_DIR`,
  `VERSION`, `SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `FIX_SCHEMA_NAME`) → `os.environ` in `main()`.
  The script reads only env vars, not CLI args.
- **Input rules in `main()`:**
  - A leading `v` is removed from `VERSION` (`v1.0.0` becomes `1.0.0`).
  - `FIX_SCHEMA_NAME` is true only for the case-insensitive string `"true"`.
  - When the user does not set an input, `action.yml` gives an empty string,
    not an unset variable. Thus `VERSION` can be `""` in the action but `None`
    in the tests (`delenv`).
- **Schema name:** the file name without `.json`. Synapse names must have parts
  (separated by periods) that start with a letter and contain only letters and
  numbers. `FIX_SCHEMA_NAME` changes `-` and `_` to `.` (SYNPY-1777), so
  `Patient-Schema.json` becomes `Patient.Schema`.
- **Output:** `uris` goes to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` as a multiline heredoc with the
  delimiter `EOF`, one URI on each line. Downstream workflows split it by lines
  (see DPE-1790), so do not change its shape.

## Conventions

- Use GitHub workflow commands for messages: `::error::` to stderr, normal
  progress to stdout. The tests check the stream (`captured.err` or
  `captured.out`) and the exact text, for example
  `"::error:: ORG_NAME environment variable is required"` (one space after
  `::error::`) and `"Registered: Patient version 1.0.0"`.
- To add or rename an input or output, change all 4 places: `action.yml`
  `inputs`/`outputs`, `action.yml` `runs.env`, the script, and the README
  Inputs/Outputs tables.
- Release tags: `vX.Y.Z` and a floating major tag (`v1`) that moves to each new
  1.x release. The README examples use `@v1`. The only tag now is `0.1.0`.

## Constraints

- Keep the `Dockerfile` `FROM` tag as the only place that sets the synapseclient
  version. Do not `pip install` anything in the `Dockerfile`. The base image has
  no pip, and Dependabot changes only the `FROM` line, so a second pin would
  silently downgrade the client (DPE-1851).
- Keep the `FROM` line in the form
  `ghcr.io/sage-bionetworks/synapsepythonclient:vX.Y.Z@sha256:<digest>`. The CI
  step "Read base image from Dockerfile" parses it with a bash regex and fails
  on other forms. Update the tag and the digest together.
- Use only release image tags, not `develop-<sha>` tags. Dependabot cannot follow
  develop tags, so the action did not get the conditional fixes in 4.12 and 4.14
  (DPE-1851).
- When the base image changes the Python version, update `PYTHON_VERSION` in
  `ci.yml` by hand. The step "Check Python version matches base image" fails
  until the two values are the same. Do not write the current Python or
  synapseclient version in this file.
- Pin each action whose owner is not `actions/` to a full commit SHA with a
  `# vX.Y.Z` comment. This is the Sage repo security policy.
- Do not change the CI org `dpetest` to a production org. The CI jobs
  (other than pytest) really register schemas in it.

## Anti-Patterns — Do NOT

- Do NOT expect a re-run with the same `VERSION` to pass. Synapse cannot
  overwrite a registered schema version, and `register_schema` calls
  `sys.exit(1)` on the first failure. A partial run leaves some schemas
  registered and writes no `uris` output (DPE-1790).
- Do NOT trust the failure counter or the "Registration Summary" in `main()` on
  failure. `register_schema` exits before it returns `None`, so `failed_count`
  stays 0 and the summary and `GITHUB_OUTPUT` write never run. If you change
  this to "continue on error", update the tests that expect exit code 1.
- Do NOT move the env var checks above `syn.login()` without a reason.
  `syn.login()` runs first, so all tests (also the "missing ORG_NAME" tests)
  need a valid `SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Do NOT trust `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. It is template text: it refers
  to `entrypoint.sh` and shell conventions, but the action is a Python script.

## Testing

- `tests/test_register_json_schemas.py` has only integration tests. They call
  `main()` against the real Synapse and do not mock anything. Set inputs with
  `monkeypatch.setenv`/`delenv`. The module imports the script by putting `src/`
  on `sys.path`.
- A module-scoped fixture makes a random org (`test.org.id<8 hex>`) and deletes
  its schemas and the org at the end. All tests in the module share it, so two
  tests must not register the same schema name and version.
- Run pytest from the repo root. The tests use relative paths
  (`./tests/schema_dir`) and make `text.txt` and `empty_test_dir` in the
  current directory.
- `test_non_json` and `test_malformed_json` check exact synapseclient and Synapse
  error text. They can break when the base image version changes. Run the tests
  before you merge a Dependabot `FROM` update.
- Fixture dirs: `schema_dir` (2 valid schemas), `schema_dir_invalid_names` (`-`
  and `_` names for `FIX_SCHEMA_NAME`), `non_schema_dir` (not JSON),
  `malformed_schema_dir` (JSON that Synapse rejects). `data_model.csv` is the
  input for the CI `generate-jsonschema` job, not for pytest.

## Related Systems

- `generate-jsonschema` (sibling action): its `schemas` output is this action's
  `schema-dir` input. It uses the same base image and the same version rule.
  The CI `test-workflow` job uses `generate-jsonschema@main`.
- Promotion of a pre-release to a release does not trigger `release: published`.
  Thus caller workflows can skip registration (DPE-1650).
